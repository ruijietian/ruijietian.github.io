<p>With the widespread use of mobile and sensing devices, and the popularity of online map-based services, such as navigation services, the volume of spatio-temporal data is growing rapidly. Conventional big data technologies in existing distributed systems cannot effectively process spatio-temporal big data with temporal continuity and spatial proximity. How to construct an effective index for the application requirements of spatio-temporal data in a distributed environment has become one of the hotspots of spatio-temporal big data research. Many spatio-temporal indexing methods have been proposed to support efficient query processing of spatio-temporal data. In this article, the various spatio-temporal big data indexing methods proposed by domestic and foreign researchers from 2010 to 2020 are classified and summarized according to the distributed environment and application background, and the hot issues that need to be paid attention to in the future are proposed according to the changes in application requirements</p>

<p>In recent years, the volume of spatial data has rapidly grown, so it is crucial to process them in an efficient manner. The level of parallel processing in big data platforms such as Hadoop and Spark is determined by partitioning the dataset. A common approach is to split the data into chunks based on the number of bytes. While this approach works well for text-based batch processing, in many cases, it is preferable to take advantage of the structured information contained in the dataset (e.g., spatial coordinates) to plan data partitioning. In view of the huge amount of data and the impossibility of quickly establishing partitions, this paper designs a method for approximate partition boundary solving, which divides the data space into multiple non-overlapping symmetric bins and samples each bin, making the probability density of the sampling set bounded by the deviation of the probability density of the original data. The sampling set is read into the memory at one time for calculation, and the established partition boundary satisfies the partition threshold-setting. Only a few boundary adjustment operations are required, which greatly shortens the partition time. In this paper, the method proposed in the paper is tested on the synthetic dataset, the bus trajectory dataset, and six common spatial partitioning methods (Grid, Z-curve, H-curve, STR, Kd-tree, and R*-Grove) are selected for comparison. The results show that the symmetric bin sampling method can describe the spatial data distribution well and can be directly used for partition boundary division.</p>

<p>With the rise of mobile terminals and the maturity of positioning technology, the amount of available spatiotemporal data continues to grow rapidly, so it is crucial to be able to process it efficiently. This paper proposes a multi-level indexing technique based on context dimension awareness. It first selects the partition order by the unit scale of each context dimension in the dataset. Second, it consider the distribution of each context dimension in the dataset, choose an appropriate partitioning method, and divide the dataset into multiple balanced splits. We test the method on real-world datasets, and experiments show that the speed of query execution increased and resource-use efficiency improved by our approach.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of large-scale trajectory data has prompted researchers to develop multiple large-scale trajectory data management systems. One of the fundamental requirements of all these systems, regardless of their architecture, is to partition data efficiently between machines. In the typical query operations of tracks, the query on ID is a frequent operation of track query, such as ID time range query, ID space range query, etc. A widely used ID indexing technique is to reuse an existing search tree, such as a Kd-tree, by building a temporary tree for the input samples and using its leaf nodes as partition boundaries. However, we show in this paper that this approach has significant limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new index, BOD-tree, which inherits the main features of the Kd-tree and can also partition the dataset into multiple balanced splits. We test the method on real datasets, and extensive experiments show that our algorithm can improve resource usage efficiency.</p>

<p>For resolving or alleviating the transportation problems, it is necessary to efficiently manage the public transportation and provide public transport services with high quality and advocate green travel, which rely on accurate traffic data. In order to obtain more accurate bus speed in the future, this paper proposed a novel dynamic hierarchical spatial-temporal network model based on Grey Relation Analysis (EGRA), the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). The proposed model is named the DHSTN; it exploited EGRA to analyze and choose the suitable candidate line sections with high impacts on the target section and, then, construct a multilayer structure based on the CNN, GRU, and attention mechanism to analyze and capture the spatial and temporal dependency, and finally, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is exploited for the fusion of the long-term and short-term dependency to predict the bus speed variation in the next time interval. Comparative experiments indicate that the DHSTN has better performances, the mean absolute error is around 2.6, and it meets the real requirements.</p>
